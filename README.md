### Functional Requirements by Team Member

#### Member-1: MD SAIDUL ISLAM APU

**1. Authentication and Role-Based Features**  
This module manages Login, Logout, Registration, Password Management, Role-Based Access Control, and Google Authentication, ensuring a secure and user-friendly experience.

- **User Registration & Validation**  
  Users must provide Name, Email, Date of Birth, Gender, and Password. Validation checks completeness and email format. Duplicate email/user triggers: “Account already exists. Try logging in.” (React Toastify/SweetAlert).

- **Password Management**  
  Users confirm current password before updating. Error: “Current password doesn’t match.” Success: “Password updated successfully.” with session refresh.

- **Role-Based Access Control**  
  JWT decoded on login to determine role (Admin, Patient/User, Doctor). Role-specific permissions and routes. Unauthorized access redirects to “403 – Access Denied” page.

- **Google Authentication**  
  Login via Google (Supabase/Clerk). On success: verify credentials, store/update user data, issue JWT, redirect to dashboard. On failure: “Google authentication failed. Please try again.”

**2. Activity Logs & History**  
Maintains detailed logs for critical actions (authentication, password changes, role modifications).

- Automatic entry creation in Activity Logs collection.
- Admin can filter by User (ID/name), Date range (e.g., today, last week), Activity Type (Login, Password Change, Role Modification).
- Dynamic table: User ID, Action Type, Description, Timestamp.
- Error handling: “Unable to fetch logs. Try again later.” / “No logs found for the selected criteria.”

**3. Search & AI Doctor Finder**  
Enables real-time and AI-powered doctor discovery.

- Real-time search by name/specialty with instant suggestions and grid results (Name, Specialty, Ratings, Availability, Profile Link).
- AI Doctor Finder (Google Gemini API): processes natural language prompts (e.g., “Find a heart specialist near me” or “I have a kidney problem”) → extracts terms → maps to specialties (e.g., Cardiology, Urology) → returns relevant doctors with Name, Specialty, Location, Rating, Availability.
- Error messages: “No doctors found matching your search. Please try a different search term.” / “Something went wrong while fetching results. Please try again later.”

**4. Emergency & On-Call Appointments**  
“Emergency Appointment” button bypasses standard scheduling and sends real-time alerts (Socket.io/WebSocket) to on-call doctors and admins.  
- Doctor accepts → patient assigned slot (visible to admin).  
- Doctor rejects → appointment marked as rejected.
